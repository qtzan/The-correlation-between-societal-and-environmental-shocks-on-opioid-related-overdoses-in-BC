### Monetary Tightening and Opioid-Related Harms in Canada: A Province-Quarter Analysis of Deaths and Hospitalizations (2016–2025)

# Project Overview

This project investigates whether rapid Bank of Canada interest rate hikes (“monetary tightening shocks”) are associated with subsequent increases in opioid-related harms across Canadian provinces. Using a province-by-quarter dataset from 2016Q1 to 2025Q2, we will analyze opioid toxicity deaths and opioid-related hospitalizations and test whether these outcomes tend to rise in the 1–2 quarters following major rate increases. Our current focus is building a clean, analysis-ready panel dataset by standardizing quarterly opioid outcomes by province, constructing quarterly interest-rate shock variables (including lagged versions), and preparing the merged dataset for statistical analysis and visualization.

This project is currently a work in progress and is done under Youreka Canada.
