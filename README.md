### Correlation between societal and environmental impacts in British Columbia with following opioid mortalities and hospitalizations

- This project aims to examine a multitude of datasets to examine whether major societal and environmental shocks in British Columbia are associated with changes in opioid-related harms over time. Using Quarterly opioid toxicity deaths and opioid-related hospitalizations (2016Q1-2025Q2), we are attempting to create shock indicators from COVID-19 interventions and environmental exposure measures (specifally extreme temperature and wildfire smoke), then merge them into a single quarterly dataset to explore whether higher shock periods align with increases in opioid harms. 

This project is currently a work in progress and is done under Youreka Canada.
